## 1- Introduction
- This repository is developed to be a reference for myself(Mesut Cem AKIN) as an Embedded Software Engineer. 
  The purpose is basically showing What I know about Embbedded Software Development.I choose an Assignment project 
  as a base for my repository. The assignment was simple enough so anyone reading the code could easily understand 
  what has been done and also it was complex enough to show if someone know how to develop software in an Embedded
  environment.

## 2- Requirements For Assignment Was
  If a button on a circuit pressed Long(3 seconds) a led in same circuit should start blinking whith a sequence of
  4 times (1 second on 1 second off) 4 times (2 second on 2 second Off) and If same button pressed short led should blink
  with a sequence of 2 times (1 second on 1 second off) 2 times (2 second on 2 second off). When Led blink sequence is in
  one blink mode If button pressed to set mode same, Blink sequence should not change. A 100 ms debounce will be to applied
  to push button. The developed code should be open for enhancements for 2 channel uart and LCD Display ...etc support.
  (This assignment was given me by a company as a job interview project I am Not giving company's name to prevent anyone
   find this repo if they google the company name)

## 3- Isn't This too simple for a Senior Developer?
   Yes it is. But Would you really spend time for reading anything complexer than this ? I doubt that :).

## 4- What did I complete so far ?
   I finished developing the assignment project which is explained in section  "3" and uploaded it to git hub.
   The assignment is pretty simple but the project is developed to be a good Skelton for much complex applications,
   There will be a lot of enhancements in future.

## 5- Future Work 
   In this section I will write what I am planning to add this repository in future as a list and I also
   Plan to manage these steps via Git Hub Issue tags.

	- Write a Make file.
	- Travis Integration.
	- Develop Unit tests.	
	- Port To Embedded Linux Platform (Raspberry Pi)
	- Port To RTOS (Free RTOS)
	- Add an UART based debug-log interface
	- Add Network Support (TCP UDP ... etc)
	- Add a Secure Boot Loader.
	- Add a PC Simulator (QT)
	- Add SSL etc. Security support.
